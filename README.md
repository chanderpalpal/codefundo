Problem Statement: To predict and prevent the impact of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods and save more and more life.
First, we focus on earthquakes then floods
We understand this plan on small bases (A building) we can implement it after to big level
   1.	Due to earthquakes a city or area destroyed in few second. its casus a great loss of life and property.so in order to solution of  this natural problem first of all we have infrastructure like that due to small earthquakes we donâ€™t have to face any problem. All    major places (like mall, railway station, bus stand, offices, market) in a city must have earthquake proof building. So, the danger from  small earthquake is less. Master plan of buildings are must have such an emergency solution that if any problem come then people will go    from there within 1-2 minutes.
    After research and previous knowledge, we know that a small pulse came before coming big earthquake. There is a time gap of 10-20 seconds in both. if we able to sense small pulse we could able to save more life  
    So, we install earthquakes sensor in many places in a building from the data received from sensor we can predict that either earthquake come or not. If sensor receive pulse then the warning system active and then we can save more and more life.

   2.	in coastal cities the earthquake cause of tsunami if earthquake on rector scale is grater then 6.5 then it may cause tsunami.so using this sensors and data analysis it can also helpful in predicting tsunami.

   3.	In order to predict flood due to rivers we should install a device that send data of speed of water and level of water. From       satellites we can collect the data of rain in particular area (river area). so, with the help of both data we analyse the water flow
    And we could able to predict flood. the and warning should be sent to local warning centres and peoples living there. By this technique I think we could able to save more life and other loss.

  In first para we talk about building plan and map I think it is not only helpful for natural disaster but also it helpful in the situation of fire and terrorist attack.

So, I think these ideas will helpful to predict and prevent the impact of earthquakes and floods
